# CollegeTrackr

Working at an executive search firm that recruits for primarily higher education jobs, searching for viable and appropriate candidates at colleges and universities across the country requires research that's targeted by region, state, school size, and various affliliations like R1/R1, AAU, and other top school lists. This application strives to collect and organize these institutions in ways that will be helpful to achieve these research goals, assuring thorough coverage for each new job search.

## Getting Started

Hosted on Render: https://college-trackr.onrender.com/
Github repo: https://github.com/nickycraig/college_trackr

## User Stories

Users will be able to visit institutions organized by region/state. From the state level, the institutions are viewable by student body size (sm, med, lg). School are also organized into important lists like R1 institutions or academic medical centers.

## Icebox features

The vision of this application is that it can grow in many ways: adding lists of the top schools in each academic area/discipline; adding lists of important affiliations and organizations by administrative function; adding specific job searches to keep track of all the institutions as they are researched and sourced for candidates. In this respect, it would be excellent to have a user login so each user could add their own searches and keep track very specifically of what research they've completed for each job search.
